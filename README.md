## Strategy

Sustainable Investing is a webite designed for retail investors looking for more information on sustainable investment. Sustainable Investing aims to be a credible starting point for retail investors looking for guidance to inform sustainable investment decisions, providing ideas and access to resources to move forward with sustainable investments.

### Target Audience:

- People who want to invest their money in sustainable assets
- First time investors
- Existing investors looking for new investment ideas

## Scope

Sustainable Investing provides an introduction to people considering investing in a sustainable manner. 

Ease-of-use is defined by mobile-first, responsive design, with simple navigation and clearly marked links to external resources.

The site includes a sign-up funcition to start and build a relationship with the audience.

## Structure

Sustainable Investing is split into four clear sections:

1. What is sustainable investing?
- an introduction to sustainable investing

2. Why invest sustainably?
- guidance on why investors should consider investing in sustainable assets
- factors to consider when making sustainable investments

3. How to start investing sustainably?
- suggestions about the type of sustainable investments to consider
- links to external sites to make investments in sustainable assets

4. Newsletter sign-up 
- access additional information in the future

## Features

The site is designed to be easy to use and to quickly access useful information on sustainable investing, which is why the site is on one scrolling mobile-friendly page. 

The navigation bar is simple and intuitive with a hover function to help guide the user. The punctuation (?, ?, !, +) in the Nav links is included to emphaise the words.

The hero image text is in a complimentary call out box, ensuring the message is clear. The messaging is to reassure the user that sustainable investments can be impactful. The arrow on the hero image invites the readers to scroll down on screens where the section text is not visible.

On smaller screens (less than 850px) there is a back to top button, designed so the user can easily move back to the navigation bar to access additional information. The button activates once the user has scrolled 20px from the top. The back to top button is removed on larger screens as the full content is easy to access via scroll.

The website provides integrated links to additional external services that help people make a start in sustainable investing. Links have a hover function to help them stand out. All external links open in a new tab.

There is a newsletter sign-up under the More+ section. This provides the user with the opportunity to access regular updates and additional information on sustainable investing. The newsletter is in a call out box, designed to stand out on the page. The required fields have been kept simple to make it easy for the user to sign up, with just first name (so emails can be personalised) and email address - both fields are required. The input fields are labelled to improve accessibility. The subscribe button is highlighted on hover to demonstrate that this is actively clickable by the user.

The footer includes links to social media sites, so that users can connect and access more information on sustainable investing. The links open in a new tab. The footer also includes a disclaimer making it clear that the site is not making recommendations about particular investments or any of the external sources linked on the website.
